# QR-Code-Challenge
This is a solution of the QR Code challenge from Frontend Mentor

This is my first challenge that I do of the Frontend Mentor platform, I did it applying a little flexbox to obviously position well the things that I had to position in the middle.
In the repository you will find images of how it should be and downloading the repository you can see the final result of the project!
I hope you like it and if you have any recommendations and want to let me know, I leave my contact email at the end of this README.
